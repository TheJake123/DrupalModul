Technological advances (visual computing, sensors, speech analysis and synthesis, ambient displays, etc.) are opening up a plethora of new interaction possibilities which are to be presented and discussed in this lecture in a systematic way. Basic interaction principles will be presented along with their possible implementation in hard- and software.\n","lehrinhalte":"Students will work in small project teams on the prototypical implementation\nof UUI solutions.
