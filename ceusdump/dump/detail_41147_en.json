In particular, the following topics are foreseen:\n(1) Distribution Theory behind WebIS, focusing on distributed database aspects such as consistency, availability, scalability as well as mobility techniques;\n(2) Web Data Management, referring to Web content reuse basing, e.g. on Mashups and the linked data standard, Web querying like distributed XML processing, and Web content engineering including NoSQL, NewSQL, Graph-based and XML-based stores, cloud and in-memory storage, and CMS;\n(3) Web Intelligence, covering crowdsourcing, spatio\/temporal\/thematic aggregation, context\/situation-awareness, and process-awareness;\n(4) Specific Categories of WebIS such as Social and Semantic WebIS, dealing with aspects like social and semantic sensors and data streams, content\/people\/network metadata, and social and semantic domain ontologies for representing, e.g., sensor or provenance information;\n(5) Development Techniques for WebIS, especially emphasizing on model-driven development and web authoring\n","beurteilung":"- Exam\n- Exercises\n- Oral participation\n","sonstiges":"<a class='urllink' href='http:\/\/www.cis.jku.at' title='' rel='nofollow'>http:\/\/www.cis.jku.at<\/a>\n","voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":"- Lecture\n- Exercises\n","literatur":"Will be announced during course.\n","equivalent":null,"children":[]}
