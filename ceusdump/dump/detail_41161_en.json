It finds many applications in domains such as, 3D reconstruction, robotics, medical engineering, media technology, automatization, biometry, human-computer-interaction, contact free measurement, remote sensing, quality control, etc. This course will give first insights into the basics of Computer Vision. At the end of the semester, participants of this class will be able to apply and implement computer vision methods independently. A basic understanding of programming concepts is required. Detailed knowledge in a programming language, however, is not necessary. A sufficient introduction into Matlab is part of the hands-on component of this class. The class is structured into interleaved lectures, labs and seminars.\n","lehrinhalte":"Spatial and frequency domain processing, gradient domain processing, segmentation and object recognition, basics of cameras, geometric camera calibration, the geometry of multiple views, stereoscopic depth estimation, range scanning and data processing, structure from motion, computational photography, introduction into Matlab and Matab's image processing toolbox, introduction into lightfield processing.\n","beurteilung":"Written exam (oral exam in exceptional cases), practical lab assignment\n","sonstiges":"<a class='urllink' href='http:\/\/www.jku.at\/cg\/content\/e48361\/e174976\/e48366\/' title='' rel='nofollow'>http:\/\/www.jku.at\/cg\/content\/e48361\/e174976\/e48366\/<\/a>\n","voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":"1) Computer Vision \u2013 A Modern Approach, Forsyth and Ponce, 2nd edition, Addison Wesley, ISBN-10: 013608592X, 2011\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>2) Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, Hartley and Zisserman, 2nd edition, Cambridge Press, ISBN: 0521540518, 2003\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>3) Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, Richard Szeliski, Springer, ISBN: 1848829345, 2010\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>4) Image Processing: The Fundamentals, Maria Petrou and Costas Petrou, Wiley, 2nd edition, ISBN-10: 047074586X, 2010\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>5) Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library, Gary Bradski, Adrian Kaehler, Mike Loukides, Robert Romano, O'Reilly Media, ISBN: 9780596516130, 2008\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>6) Handbook of Mathematical Models in Computer Vision, Nikos Paragios and Yunmei Chen, Springer, ISBN-10: 0387263713, 2005\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>7) Machine Vision.
