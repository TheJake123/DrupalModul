Moreover, methods for semantic integration based on ontologies and knowledge representation languages are explained. Additionally, business applications of integrated information systems are presented. Practical experiences are gained by using the methods and their application in exercises and examples.\n","lehrinhalte":"Information integration, representation of data, distribution, autonomy, heterogeneity, integration architectures, schema- and meta data management, ontologies, ontology engineering, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, data warehouses, business applications\n","beurteilung":"Written exam as well as the submission and evaluation of exercises\n","sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":"Slide-based presentation, exercises\n","literatur":null,"equivalent":"<sup><acronym title='Unfortunately this information is not available in english.'>(*)<\/acronym><\/sup><strong>in collaboration with 921INSYASWK13: KV Accessible Software and Web Design (1,5 ECTS) equivalent to<\/strong><br \/>INMIPKVKCSY: KV Knowledge-centered Systems (4,5 ECTS)\n","children":[]}
