The specialization in Pervasive Computing therefore deals with a combination of technologies (e.g., sensors, actuators, wireless communication, miniaturized memories and processors), paradigms (e.g., context-aware and adaptive systems, autonomous and self-organizing systems, organic and bio-inspired systems) and methods (e.g., for inter-action, coordination, computational perception, reasoning and learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, semantic interoperability, system reliability, security, and user friendliness). The educational goals are decision and evaluation skills as well as skills for designing and developing pervasive computing systems such as \"information appliances\", \"wearable systems\", or \"ambient intelligence systems\". \n","lehrinhalte":"The contents of this subject result from the contents of its courses. \n","beurteilung":null,"sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":null,"equivalent":null,"children":[{"id":41161},{"id":41162},{"id":41163},{"id":41164},{"id":41165},{"id":41166},{"id":41167},{"id":41168},{"id":41169},{"id":41170},{"id":41171}]}
