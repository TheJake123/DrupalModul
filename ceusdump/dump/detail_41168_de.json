Students should get a good knowledge about the state of the art in how to model and implement cooperative systems. The course intends to teach the students the basics of cooperative systems that will enable them to do further research and practical work in this field.\n","lehrinhalte":"In the first part of the lecture, an overview of different types of cooperative systems is given, including an algorithmic, functional and architectural perspective.\nNext, the theoretical background and main models of communication, coordination and collaboration are presented including a review of current research problems in the field. The last part of the \nlecture is dedicated to the development and evaluation of cooperative systems, including development and evaluation methods, key HW\/SW enabling technologies and tool support. The course concludes with selectd application scenarios and case studies.\n","beurteilung":"written exam at the end of the course (closed book exam)\n","sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":"classroom teaching, selected additional reading material for students, optional interactive exercises for students to deepen understanding\n","literatur":"Study material will be given in the lecture.\n","equivalent":"INMIPVOCOOP: VO Cooperative Systems (3 ECTS) <strong>or<\/strong> INBVEVOTEKO: VO Telekooperation (3 ECTS) \n","children":[]}
