The reading will give you a broad picture of what global strategy is all about. Furthermore, this course will provide the students with the opportunity to sharpen the written and oral presentation competencies.\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>The course contains two regular case teaching sessions and three competitive case sessions.<br \/>Preparatory questions will be assigned along with all teaching case sessions. Students are expected to analyze the case within their working group before coming to class and to prepare a five slide Power Point presentation summarizing their key findings. The slides form the basis for the student assessment, as well as the discussion of the cases in the class. \n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>In each of three competitive case sessions, two groups (thus, competing session) will be asked to present their case analysis and strategic recommendation for the case at hand. Student will also need to provide a written case analysis before the presentation, which will be made public to the course for comments and critique. Non-presenting students will be asked to provide a question to the presentation prior the session which will form the basis for the participation mark.\n","beurteilung":"<sup><acronym title='Leider ist diese Information in Deutsch nicht verf\u00fcgbar.'>(*)<\/acronym><\/sup>Group Level (40 %)\n- Analysis for Teaching Cases (10%)\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>- Analysis for Competing Cases (30%)\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>Individual Level (60 %)\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>- In-Class Participation (20%)\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>- Written Exam (40 %)\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>Students will be assessed on:\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>-\tTheir knowledge on the content domain of Global Strategic Management\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>-\tTheir ability to understand the strategic issues in the cases they present, to use the appropriate analytical techniques and to marshal the relevant data\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>-\tThe quality of the presentations, the written reports and the examination questions; by quality in this context we mean the clarity and persuasiveness of each bit of work.

Assignment to groups and sessions will be done in the first lecture. The case assignment consists of two parts: a written case report (1000 words, A4 format, 1.5 spacing, font Times 12) and the actual presentation (.ppt, .key or .pdf format). Both the verbal presentation and the submitted overall report will be assessed.  \n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>Teaching Case Assignment:  Each group is required to discuss and prepare the cases specified in the course outline for the respective sessions. For each teaching case assignment, groups may be asked at random to present their findings to the class.
