Technological advances (visual computing, sensors, speech analysis and synthesis, ambient displays, etc.) are opening up a plethora of new interaction possibilities which are to be presented and discussed in this lecture in a systematic way. Basic interaction principles will be presented along with their possible implementation in hardware and software.\n","lehrinhalte":"Classification of UIs, interaction principles, selected I\/O technologies, development methods and tools, evaluation.\n","beurteilung":null,"sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":null,"equivalent":"INMPPVOUUIN: VO Unconventional User Interaction (3 ECTS) \n","children":[]}
