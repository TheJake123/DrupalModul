Indeed, all engineering disciplines (e.g., mechanical, electrical, aeronautical, control engineering) rely extensively on models to help describe a solution but also to help in the decision making process. Software engineering thrives to be an engineering disciplines and while models are not yet used extensively in practice, models already have many uses today. \n","lehrinhalte":"This course will explore these many uses, in part through presentations but also in part through teams of students exploring and reporting about model-driven engineering tools. The course is very much applied with the goal of students researching model driven engineering tools\/technologies of their choosing and presenting about it.\n","beurteilung":"Grade is composed of project grade and exam grade. \n","sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":null,"equivalent":"<sup><acronym title='Unfortunately this information is not available in english.'>(*)<\/acronym><\/sup>INMAWVOMENG: VO Model Engineering (3 ECTS)\n","children":[]}
