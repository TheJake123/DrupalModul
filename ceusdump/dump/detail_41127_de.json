It is shaping our lives by enabling new technologies well beyond the traditional engineering of technical and physical systems. At JKU the specialization of Computational Engineering focuses on discrete methods of modeling and computation in informatics and mathematics, and their applications to innovative engineering disciplines from computer systems and robotics to biological systems and fine arts. The Master's program emphasizes the value of new computational methods as a driver for entirely new areas of engineering, and prepares graduates with foundational knowledge to solve problems within the broad arena of systems engineering. \n","lehrinhalte":"The contents of this subject result from the contents of its courses. \n","beurteilung":null,"sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":null,"equivalent":null,"children":[{"id":41128},{"id":41129},{"id":41130},{"id":41131},{"id":41132},{"id":41133},{"id":41134},{"id":41135},{"id":41136},{"id":41137}]}
