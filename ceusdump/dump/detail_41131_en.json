An analog filter is attached to complete the DAC structure. This hardware chain, that is often applicable in audio devices, as example between the CD-Reader (digital) and the loudspeaker (analog), is being used to convey a detailed understanding of the design methods of digital integrated circuits and of the interface between digital and analog world.\n<\/p>\n<p class='vspace'>Design Methods of digital integrated circuits,\nHardware description language VHDL,\nStructure of FPGAs,\nFPGA-Synthesis,\nPrinciples of analog-to-digital \/ digital-to-analog converters\n(signals and systems, quantization, structure),\nDesign of Sigma-Delta Modulators\/DACs,\nFilter-Design (needed for designing the Sigma-Delta Modulator and the\nanalog filter).\n","beurteilung":null,"sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":null,"literatur":null,"equivalent":"<sup><acronym title='Unfortunately this information is not available in english.'>(*)<\/acronym><\/sup>INMIPVOHWEW: VO Hardwareentwurf (3 ECTS)\n","children":[]}
