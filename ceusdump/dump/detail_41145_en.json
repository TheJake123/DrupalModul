Hereafter, methods to analyze the extracted features will be discussed, in particular, methods of linear and non-linear data analysis for pattern discovery and information visualization.\n","beurteilung":"written exam, practical exercise(s)\n","sonstiges":null,"voraussetzungen":null,"methoden":"lectures, practical exercise(s)\n","literatur":"Slides, Scientific Papers, supporting book \"Multimedia Retrieval\"\n","equivalent":null,"children":[]}
