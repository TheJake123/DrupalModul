To build the documentation, open the Doxyfile locatedin this folder in doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html)

Before doing this, empty the Systemdocumentation/html and /latex folders.
Doxygen generates a documentation in html (open the index.html for this one) and one in LaTeX, which can be converted to PDF (see Systemdokumentation/PDF/HOWTO Create a PDF.txt)

!!!DO NOT DELETE THE Systemdokumentation/index.html or the PDF folder!!!
